# User Guide
21/10/2019 Supports SgrS, HicA-HicB and Surface Plot

Our E.co Grow software allows users to run hundreds of simulations in order to gain useful insights without carrying out elaborate experiments. The foundation of this software lies in our models of the HicA-HicB and SgrS systems which have been built using our characterization data. On the basis of a few inputs specified by users, our software can predict bacterial growth trends and offer experimental design recommendations to suit their purpose. By harnessing the power of modelling, our software aims to effectively reduce the number of experiments carried out by the wet lab to test and optimise the system.
